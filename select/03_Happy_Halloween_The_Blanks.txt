Hap-hap-happy--
Happy, laughing pumpkin
Hap-hap-happy--
Sitting on your lawn
Hap-hap-happy--
Wants to tell you somethin'
Hap-hap-happy--
Listen to his song
Happy, happy, happy Halloween
(Ha-ha, Ho-ho, Ha-ha, Hee-hee)
Happy, happy, happy Halloween (laughing)
(Ha, ha, ha)
Hap-hap-happy--
Pumpkin has to leave now
Hap-hap-happy--
Lest he decompose
Hap-hap-happy--
Bouncing down the sidewalk
Hap-hap-happy--
Laughing as he goes
Happy, happy, happy Halloween
Happy, happy, happy Halloween (laughing)
(Laughing) Ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha
